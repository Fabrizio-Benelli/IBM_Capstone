    "Here we are at the final test of this long course. I should have acquired all the skills and tools to use location data to explore a geographic location. I now have the opportunity to be as creative as I wish and to see how to take advantage of Foursquare's Location Data to explore or compare the neighborhoods or cities of my choice and to find a problem that I can use to solve Foursquare's location data. I have to clearly define the problem of my choice, where I have to take advantage of Foursquare's location data to solve. I have to remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so I have to explicitly describe my target audience and why they care about the problem. The purpose of this project is to find a safe place for restaurants to open in San Francisco, United States. In particular, this work is aimed at anyone who wants to open a restaurant in San Francisco, in the United States. First I have to choose the safest neighborhood by analyzing the crime data for the opening of the restaurant and a list of a neighborhood, where the restaurants are located as close as possible to the city of San Francisco, but in any case in unusual places. I will use data science tools to analyze the data and focus on the safest district and explore its neighborhoods and the ten most common locations in each neighborhood so that I can select the best neighborhood where the bar is not among the most common places."

To do this, I first collected the data on crime of any kind, large, small, important or not. The goal was to find a safe place so as to make customers and even restaurant managers safe. I achieved this by grouping the neighborhoods in clusters by providing the potential entrepreneur and manager of the restaurant with places and greater protections to be taken.\n"

So I divided them by neighborhood and districts and grouped in such a way as to identify the safest neighborhoods.
