    "Here I describe the data that I will use to solve the problem. I must remember that I will have to use Foursquare's location data to solve the problem. I can also use other datasets in combination with Foursquare location data. So I have to make sure that I provide adequate explanations and discussions, with examples, of the data I will use, even if it is only data on Foursquare's position.\n",

    "Part 1: Using a Kaggle real world data set containing San Francisco crimes from 2003 to 2019: a data set consisting of the crime statistics of each San Francisco neighborhood along with the crime type, year, month and now register.\n",

    "Part 2: Collection of additional information on the list of districts officially classified in San Francisco from Wikipedia: information on the districts will be used to map the existing data in which each district can be assigned to the right district.\n",

    "Part 3: Creation of a new consolidated neighborhood dataset, together with their districts, crime data and respective neighborhood coordinates.: This data will be retrieved using OpenCage Geocoder to find the safest district and explore the neighborhood on maps using Folium and perform exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 4: creation of a new consolidated dataset of the most common neighborhoods, districts and locations and of the respective neighborhood together with coordinates: this data will be recovered using the FourSquare API to explore the neighborhood's locations and apply a machine-learning algorithm to group neighborhoods and present results by plotting them on maps using Folium."
